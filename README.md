# horoscopes-vue
This is a very simple Demo App showing the daily horoscope. The app uses Laravel as a backend and some VueJS components. However, since the backend does not care about saving any data, there is no real model. The app uses aztro.readthedocs.io as an API.

## Project setup
```
git clone https://github.com/remindbg/HoroscopesVue.git 
cd HoroscopesVue
composer install
php artisan key:generate

run: 
php artisan serve
```
